# Power BI Operations Dashboard  

![Dashboard Overview](assets/screenshot_overview.png)

A manufacturing-style operations dashboard that visualizes KPIs across **Production**, **Observations** (Safety & QA), and **Waste** using realistic synthetic data. Built to demonstrate practical Power BI skills: modeling, DAX, slicers, and visual storytelling.

## üì¶ Data
Dataset used in this project:  
**ManufacturingData_Realistic.xlsx**

### Tables
- **Production**: `Date`, `Shift`, `Line`, `Units_Produced`, `Efficiency_Percent`, `Downtime_Minutes`  
- **Observations** (Safety + QA): `Date`, `Observation_Type`, `Department`, `Reported_By`, `Severity`  
- **Waste**: `Date`, `Waste_Type`, `Weight_Lbs`, `Disposed` (True/False)

> Note: Data are synthetic but tuned to be plausible (noise, seasonality, and realistic distributions).

## üß± Data Model
- **Dates** (central Date table, built in DAX)
- **Production** (fact table)
- **Observations** (fact table for Safety/QA)
- **Waste** (fact table)

**Relationships**:  
- `Dates[Date]` ‚Üí `Production[Date]`  
- `Dates[Date]` ‚Üí `Observations[Date]`  
- `Dates[Date]` ‚Üí `Waste[Date]`  

All are **Many-to-One**, **Single direction**.

**DAX for Dates table:**
```DAX
Dates =
ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR ( DATE(2024,1,1), DATE(2024,12,31) ),
    "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Month", FORMAT ( [Date], "MMM" ),
    "MonthNo", MONTH ( [Date] ),
    "Weekday", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
    "WeekdayNo", WEEKDAY ( [Date], 2 )
)
üßÆ Measures (DAX)
DAX
Copy code
-- Production
Efficiency % = AVERAGE ( Production[Efficiency_Percent] )
Units Produced = SUM ( Production[Units_Produced] )
Downtime (mins) = SUM ( Production[Downtime_Minutes] )

-- Observations
Total Observations = COUNTROWS ( Observations )

-- Waste
Total Waste (lbs) = SUM ( Waste[Weight_Lbs] )
Disposed % =
DIVIDE (
    CALCULATE ( COUNTROWS ( Waste ), Waste[Disposed] = TRUE ),
    COUNTROWS ( Waste )
)
Format Efficiency % as Percentage, Disposed % as Percentage.
